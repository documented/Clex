<p>WARNING: This is a low-level function. Prefer high-level macros like
  binding where ever possible.</p>
<p>Takes a map of Var/value pairs. Binds each Var to the associated value for
  the current thread. Each call <em>MUST</em> be accompanied by a matching call to
  pop-thread-bindings wrapped in a try-finally!</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>  (push-thread-bindings bindings)
  (try
    ...
    (finally
      (pop-thread-bindings)))
