<p>Returns a lazy sequence of the nodes in a tree, via a depth-first walk.
   branch? must be a fn of one arg that returns true if passed a node
   that can have children (but may not).  children must be a fn of one
   arg that returns a sequence of the children. Will only be called on
   nodes for which branch? returns true. Root is the root node of the
  tree.</p>
