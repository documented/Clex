>   Takes a proxy instance and a map of strings (which must
>   correspond to methods of the proxy superclass/superinterfaces) to
>   fns (which must take arguments matching the corresponding method,
>   plus an additional (explicit) first arg corresponding to this, and
>   updates (via assoc) the proxy's fn map. nil can be passed instead of
>   a fn, in which case the corresponding method will revert to the
>   default behavior. Note that this function can be used to update the
>   behavior of an existing instance without changing its identity.
