>   Normally, actions sent directly or indirectly during another action
>   are held until the action completes (changes the agent's
>   state). This function can be used to dispatch any pending sent
>   actions immediately. This has no impact on actions sent during a
>   transaction, which are still held until commit. If no action is
>   occurring, does nothing. Returns the number of actions dispatched.
