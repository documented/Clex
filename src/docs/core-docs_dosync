>   Runs the exprs (in an implicit do) in a transaction that encompasses
>   exprs and any nested calls.  Starts a transaction if none is already
>   running on this thread. Any uncaught exception will abort the
>   transaction and flow out of dosync. The exprs may be run more than
>   once, but any effects on Refs will be atomic.
