>   trampoline can be used to convert algorithms requiring mutual
>   recursion without stack consumption. Calls f with supplied args, if
>   any. If f returns a fn, calls that fn with no arguments, and
>   continues to repeat, until the return value is not a fn, then
>   returns that non-fn value. Note that if you want to return a fn as a
>   final value, you must wrap it in some data structure and unpack it
>   after trampoline returns.
