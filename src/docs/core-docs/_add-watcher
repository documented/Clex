>   Experimental.
>   Adds a watcher to an agent/atom/var/ref reference. The watcher must
>   be an Agent, and the action a function of the agent's state and one
>   additional arg, the reference. Whenever the reference's state
>   changes, any registered watchers will have their actions
>   sent. send-type must be one of :send or :send-off. The actions will
>   be sent after the reference's state is changed. Var watchers are
>   triggered only by root binding changes, not thread-local set!s
