>     ([ns-sym & filters])
> 
>   refers to all public vars of ns, subject to filters.
>   filters can include at most one each of:
> 
>   :exclude list-of-symbols
>   :only list-of-symbols
>   :rename map-of-fromsymbol-tosymbol
> 
>   For each public interned var in the namespace named by the symbol,
>   adds a mapping from the name of the var to the var to the current
>   namespace.  Throws an exception if name is already mapped to
>   something else in the current namespace. Filters can be used to
>   select a subset, via inclusion or exclusion, or to provide a mapping
>   to a symbol different from the var's name, in order to prevent
>   clashes. Use :use in the ns macro in preference to calling this directly.
