>  Runs the exprs (in an implicit do) in a transaction that encompasses
>  exprs and any nested calls.  Starts a transaction if none is already
>  running on this thread. Any uncaught exception will abort the
>  transaction and flow out of sync. The exprs may be run more than
>  once, but any effects on Refs will be atomic.
