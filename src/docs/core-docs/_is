>  Generic assertion macro.  'form' is any predicate test.
>  'msg' is an optional message to attach to the assertion.
>  
>  Example: (is (= 4 (+ 2 2)) "Two plus two should be 4")
>
>  Special forms:
>
>  (is (thrown? c body)) checks that an instance of c is thrown from
>  body, fails if not; then returns the thing thrown.
>
>  (is (thrown-with-msg? c re body)) checks that an instance of c is
>  thrown AND that the message on the exception matches (with
>  re-matches) the regular expression re.
