clojure.core/subvec
([v start] [v start end])
  Returns a persistent vector of the items in vector from
  start (inclusive) to end (exclusive).  If end is not supplied,
  defaults to (count vector). This operation is O(1) and very fast, as
  the resulting vector shares structure with the original and no
  trimming is done.
