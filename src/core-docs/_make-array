([type len] [type dim & more-dims])
  Creates and returns an array of instances of the specified class of
  the specified dimension(s).  Note that a class object is required.
  Class objects can be obtained by using their imported or
  fully-qualified name.  Class objects for the primitive types can be
  obtained using, e.g., Integer/TYPE.
