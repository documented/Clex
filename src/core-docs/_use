-------------------------
clojure.core/use
([& args])
  Like 'require, but also refers to each lib's namespace using
  clojure.core/refer. Use :use in the ns macro in preference to calling
  this directly.

  'use accepts additional options in libspecs: :exclude, :only, :rename.
  The arguments and semantics for :exclude, :only, and :rename are the same
  as those documented for clojure.core/refer.
