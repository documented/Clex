clojure.core/contains?
([coll key])
  Returns true if key is present in the given collection, otherwise
  returns false.  Note that for numerically indexed collections like
  vectors and Java arrays, this tests if the numeric key is within the
  range of indexes. 'contains?' operates constant or logarithmic time;
  it will not perform a linear search for a value.  See also 'some'.
