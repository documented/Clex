clojure.core/doall
([coll] [n coll])
  When lazy sequences are produced via functions that have side
  effects, any effects other than those needed to produce the first
  element in the seq do not occur until the seq is consumed. doall can
  be used to force any effects. Walks through the successive nexts of
  the seq, retains the head and returns it, thus causing the entire
  seq to reside in memory at one time.
