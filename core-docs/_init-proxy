clojure.core/init-proxy
([proxy mappings])
  Takes a proxy instance and a map of strings (which must
  correspond to methods of the proxy superclass/superinterfaces) to
  fns (which must take arguments matching the corresponding method,
  plus an additional (explicit) first arg corresponding to this, and
  sets the proxy's fn map.
