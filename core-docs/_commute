-------------------------
clojure.core/commute
([ref fun & args])
  Must be called in a transaction. Sets the in-transaction-value of
  ref to:

  (apply fun in-transaction-value-of-ref args)

  and returns the in-transaction-value of ref.

  At the commit point of the transaction, sets the value of ref to be:

  (apply fun most-recently-committed-value-of-ref args)

  Thus fun should be commutative, or, failing that, you must accept
  last-one-in-wins behavior.  commute allows for more concurrency than
  ref-set.
